# Cloud Print - Print Anywhere, Print Anytime

Cloud Print is a native android application that allows users to take print from anywhere, at anytime from any device as long as there is internet connectivity. In simple words, we are trying to build a Uber for printers.

We currently support documents and images.

The app uses Google Maps API to display gps locations of printers and Google Cloud Print API to print.
